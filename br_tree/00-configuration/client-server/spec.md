# Client-server

Deploying BR with a separated UI (client) and business logic/data (server) over TCP/IP.
**Configuration/deployment, not coding.** OS-specific server setup is in
[platform](../platform/spec.md); start-up directives in
[config-directives](../config-directives/spec.md).

<a id="architecture"></a>
## Architecture

`BRClient` (Windows/Mac) ⇄ TCP/IP (default **port 8555**) ⇄ `BRListener` (connection agent) →
`BRServer` (runs the application). Clients and servers can be cross-platform (Windows client ↔
Linux/Mac server).

- **Server**: `BRListener.exe`/`brlistener` (manages connections, `BRListener.conf`),
  `BRServer.exe`/`brserver` (executes business logic).
- **Client**: `BRClient.exe`, optional `BR_Parms.txt`.

<a id="config"></a>
## Configuration

```ini
# BRListener.conf — global settings
logfile=/path/log    
loglevel=6    
port=8555

# Session definition
[ LABEL=BR STARTDIR=/u/myapp EXECUTABLE=/u/myapp/br/brserver 
   - optional -
CONFIG=/u/myapp/brconfig.svr 
CAPTION=<client login prompt window caption> 
ANONYMOUS=<username@password>    -- use with caution
MULTISESSION                     -- once logged in credentials are saved in listener memory
STDERR=/u/myapp/errorlog.txt
]
```
Session parameters: `LABEL` (client references it), `STARTDIR`, `EXECUTABLE`, `CONFIG`, `CAPTION`,
`ANONYMOUS` (user@password auto-login), `MULTISESSION`, `STDERR`. `BRListener` re-reads
`BRListener.conf` **fresh on every session launch** — no `install /release`+reinstall is needed for
conf edits — and `BRClient`↔`BRListener` traffic is **TLS-encrypted**. `MULTISESSION` stores a client
session ID in the client registry keyed to the login, so the listener reuses saved credentials for
subsequent sequential sessions (omit it if your app can't run multiple sessions).

```bash
BRclient 192.168.1.100 BR          # client connects to server + label
BRclient myserver.com:7543 BR      # custom port
```
`BR_Parms.txt` (must sit beside `BRClient.exe`) supplies the connection: `host=<ip|dns|localhost>`,
`label=<BRLISTENER.CONF label>`. The **`BRSERVER`** (a.k.a. legacy **`WBSERVER`**) BRConfig.sys
statement names the server data file (`BRServer.dat`/`WBServer.dat`) and needs **no drive letter**.

<a id="reconnect"></a>
## Reconnect & keepalive
`BRClient` sends a keepalive every **10 s**; `BRServer` self-terminates if none arrives for **100 s**
(failures are logged to an error file in the BRServer directory). To survive transient drops:
```text
CLIENT_SERVER RECONNECT_AFTER=20  RECONNECT_TIME=300
```
The client retries after `RECONNECT_AFTER` seconds (default 20) for up to `RECONNECT_TIME` seconds
(default 120) before aborting; while retrying it shows its **session number**, and the login window
offers a session-number box so you can **reconnect from another workstation**. On an unrecoverable
disconnect the session does the normal `Exit_After` exit — a BR error then unattended mode (no client
I/O; exits at the next keyboard wait; default 240 s). Raising the values (e.g. `999`) helps long/slow
commands, but the workstation appears to "lock up" while waiting.

<a id="cs-operations"></a>
## Client-side operations

- **Shell calls** route by flag: `-s` server, `-@` client (`EXECUTE "SYSTEM -@ dir"`); `-c`
  continue, `-r` restore screen, `-w` no shell, `-t###` timeout, `-p` page output (Linux server),
  `-m`/`-M` minimized (Windows; `-M` also off the taskbar). `-w`/`-r`/`-c` are mutually exclusive
  (error 2222); **Ctrl-]** *always* does a client shell call. Config: **`SHELL LIMIT <sec>`** sets the
  child-process timeout (default **240**; `-1` = never unless `-t`), and **`SHELL DEFAULT
  {CLIENT|SERVER}`** sets where shells run and what `WBPLATFORM$` reports (so a Mac/Linux CS app can
  present as `WINDOWS`).
- **Remote printing**: printer targets pick client vs server by suffix and `OPTION 30` —
  `PRN:/` vs `PRN:@/`, `WIN:/` vs `WIN:@/`, `DIRECT:/`, `PREVIEW:/`. Client spooling via
  `SPOOLCMD @ …` and `SPOOLPATH @ …`.
- **Client files** use the `@:` prefix: `COPY "data.txt" TO "@:C:\ClientData\data.txt"`,
  `EXISTS("@:C:\Config\settings.ini")`.
- **`CLIENT_CURRENT_DIR`** sets where `@:` (single-colon) client references resolve: a **full path**,
  **`SYNC`** (mirror each server `CD` onto the client, per-DRIVE), or **`OFF`** (default — use the client
  startup dir). The **third `DRIVE` parameter** supplies a per-drive client full path (must begin `\\`
  or `X:`) and is honored only in client-server.

## Examples

```business-rules
10100 EXECUTE "SYSTEM -s ls -la"                 ! run on server
10200 EXECUTE "SYSTEM -@ dir"                     ! run on client
10100 COPY "report.pdf" TO "@:C:\Upload\report.pdf"   ! send to client
```

<a id="service-install"></a>
## Service install & troubleshooting
On Windows the server side is a service: `install.exe` registers `C:\Windows\System32\BRListener.exe`,
and the **"BR Service was successfully started"** message means it will auto-launch each reboot until
`install.exe /release`. Install the **64-bit** `BRListener.exe` in `System32` (or the **32-bit** in
`SysWOW64`) and run the matching `BRListenerInstaller.exe` as administrator (InstallShield is no longer
used). Two listener versions can coexist for production testing — install the second with
**`/ALTERNATE <name>`** (→ service `BR_Listener-(name)`) and tag conf statements with
`@release=<ver> PORT=…`. On Linux the listener is a self-installing **`brlist`** daemon script
(`brlist install|start|stop|restart`; link `brlistener.conf`→`/etc`, `brlistener`→`/usr/sbin`). Common
errors:

| Message | Cause / fix |
|---|---|
| *Couldn't find BRLISTENER.exe in the specified (or SYSTEM) directory* | place `BRListener.exe` in `C:\Windows\System32` |
| *Couldn't open wbserver at BR Path=… / OS Path=…* | bad `DRIVE` statement in `BRConfig.sys` (or no write permission) |
| *OPTION 33 mismatch using wbserver.dat* | client/server [`OPTION 33`](../config-directives/spec.md) record-locking level differs |

<a id="security"></a>
## Security
- **`BRserver` inherits `BRListener`'s OS privileges**, then narrows them to the logging-in user's
  permissions (or the `ANONYMOUS=` user's). **`ANONYMOUS=` logs everyone in as one OS user, with no WSID
  and no password prompt — use with caution**: give that account restricted OS rights and let the
  application authenticate (remember any path is reachable under BR by prefixing it with a colon).
- **Lock down interrupts**: remap `Ctrl-A` to null and reserve a line-draw key for support staff (e.g.
  `KEYBOARD 01 41`, `KEYBOARD C0 01`, so only `Ctrl-\ 1 Ctrl-\` interrupts).
- **Windows Server**: the login account needs **"Allow log on locally"** (default admin-only on Server
  2003 — grant via Domain Controller Security Policy → User Rights Assignment).
- **Firewall/router**: change the default **port 8555**, add an inbound rule for
  `…\system32\brlistener.exe` on that port, and use NAT/port-forwarding to reach it across the internet.
