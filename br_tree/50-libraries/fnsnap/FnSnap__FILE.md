===FNBLDSORT - build a sort control file and execute the sort===

**FnBldSort** creates a sort control file with FILE RECORD and MASK statements.  The sort is then executed creating the sorted file in either PD 3, BH 4 or Record out format.  The sort control file is then deleted.  The user's local TEMP directory is used for the work space but the files in and out files can be located anywhere either as relative or absolute paths.

 FNBLDSORT(File_Name_Source$,OUTNM$,ABR$,MASK$,MAT RECORD$,INDIR$,INDRV$,OUTDIR$,OUTDRV$)

====Functions used====

None

====Variables====
{|
|-valign="top"
|width="10%"|**File_Name_Source$ **||File name that is being sorted.  The file name can contain the path either relative (without a drive letter) or absolute (with a drive letter).  If no path is included FNBLDSORT will look in the current directory for the file.
|-valign="top"
|width="10%"|**OUTNM$ **||File name that is to be created by the sort routine.  The file name can include a path just as it could with the File_Name_Source$.
|-valign="top"
|width="10%"|**ABR$ **||Type of output file to be created A=Address using the PD 3 format B=Address using the BH4 formatR=Record out sort.
|-valign="top"
|width="10%"|**MASK$ **||The file mask that should be used to designate what positions and format the sort should use in creating the sort.  The mask statement should NOT include the word MASK, but the remainder of the mask should follow the parameters detailed in `Sort facility`.  These include multiple sort positions and types in the start position, field length, field format and ascending or descending as in "11,5,C,A" or "11,5,C,A,21,5,PD D".  Only one MASK statement is allowed, but the statement may include multiple parameter sets.
|-valign="top"
|}

The following elements are optional and can be omitted from the function call.

{|
|-valign="top"
|width="10%"|**MAT RECORD$ **||Multiple RECORD statements can be used and can contain a mix of INCLUDE and OMIT statements.  Each Include or Omit statement must be in a separate element of the RECORD$ array and NOT include the word RECORD. A statement may look something like the following:
|-valign="top"
|}
 01000 DIM RECORD$(0)*100
 01010 MAT RECORD$(1) !:RECORD$(1)='O,49,1,C," "," "'
 01010 MAT RECORD$(2) !:RECORD$(2)='I,23,5,C,"aaaaa","zzzzz"'
{|
|-valign="top"
|width="10%"|** **||Notice the use of single quotes and double quotes to avoid the necessity of using multiple double quote mars in order to get quotes included in the RECORD$ array elements.
|-valign="top"
|width="10%"|**INDIR$ **||This parameter is included for compatibility with the sort utility.  The parameter should be left blank (not, included in the function call).
|-valign="top"
|width="10%"|**INDRV$ **||This parameter is included for compatibility with the sort utility.  The parameter should be left blank (not, included in the function call).
|-valign="top"
|width="10%"|**OUTDIR$ **||This parameter is included for compatibility with the sort utility.  The parameter should be left blank (not, included in the function call).
|-valign="top"
|width="10%"|**OUTDRV$ **||This parameter is included for compatibility with the sort utility.  The parameter should be left blank (not, included in the function call).
|-valign="top"
|}

====Comments====

 A very useful function where sorts are used.  PArticularly helpful in eliminating the procedure files common in older program.  Using this function chain to procedure files to create and execute sorts can be included in the primary program much as FNINDEX is used.

===FNFIL - create a file number that will increment by 1 each time a batch is created===

Create a file number and batch number for a file that will increment by 1 each time a new batch is created. Used to create sequential file names such as transmittal files to banks or taxing authorities where it important to maintain a record of what has been sent and make sure that an existing transmittal file is not overwritten.

Returns an available file number to be used in creating a file and the sequence number to be used in opening the file.

{|
|-valign="top"
|width="10%"|**FILLOC$ **||Location either relative of specific of the path into which the file should be placed.  The path should end with a "\\".  If one is not present one will be added to the path.
|-valign="top"
|width="10%"|**FILNM$ **||The first few letters of the file name to be used.  generally this is tow to three letters to identify the specific reason for the file
