;Comments:<br>
The bar will be another window which will be a child of the underlying parent window.  When the parent is closed the child will automatically close also.

===FNWINDEV - Query FNSNAP for last window opened===

Function transfers from FNSAP to the calling program the window number of the last window opened using FNWIN.  This practice is being replace in 4.17 becasue multiple windows can be opened an closed at will and does not require the strict opening of windows in a specific order.

 FNWINDEV

Description|<br>
Returns the value of the currently open window that has been opened by FNWIN
