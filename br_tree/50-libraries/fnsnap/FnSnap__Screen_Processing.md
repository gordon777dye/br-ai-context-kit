===FNCHECK - in connection with a radio dot or check box returns a 1 if checked===

Used to process the elements of a radio dot list or check box is to determine wether the element has been checked (true) or not (false)

  FNCHECK(L$*100)

;Functions used:

;Variables:
{|
|-valign="top"
|width="10%"|**L$ **||The label description being processed for an element of a radio list or check b ox list
|-valign="top"
|}
<br>
;Comments:<br>
This function is intended to be used by other functions see for example FNOPTIONS and FNOPTIONS$

Based on the results of FNCHECK or a default parameter this function will add or remove the ^ from a description that indicates if it has been checked

Returns the label modified to either contain or be free of a leading ^.
 FNCHECK$*100(L$*100,L)

;Functions used:

;Variables:
{|
|-valign="top"
|width="10%"|**L$ **||The label description to be modified if L is true
|-valign="top"
|width="10%"|**L **||A flag indicating whether the ^ is to be appended to the front of a label, or stripped from it
|-valign="top"
|}
<br>
;Comments:<br>

===FNDIALOG$*40 - Display dialog box and return selected text===

Displays a dialog box with up to three options and specifiable text.  See also FNDLG

 FNDIALOG$*40(SROW$,SCOL$,DBWIDTH,TXTSTR$*900,OPT1$*40,OPT2$*40,OPT3$*40,REMOVE,DFLTOPT,DISPANYKEY,KEYWAIT) !:

Functions used |

;Variables:
{|
|-valign="top"
|width="10%"|**
|-valign="top"
|}
<br>
;Comments:

Text does not align very well in the box when using proportional fonts.  This function can be called from FNDLG that uses an unformatted BR file to supply text and button labels.  Both functions have been updated to utilize the external utility from David Blankenship.

See also FNWAITWIN for a very useful alternative.

===FNDLG - Display a dialog box from data in a file===

Creates a dialog box from a DAT file prepared by DIALOGMN.BR

 FNDLG(DIALOG_DAT,DLNR;DISPANYKEY,KEYWAIT,SUFFIX$*300)

<br>
;Comments:

This is a carry over from earlier versions and does not align proportional text very well. If possible use MSGBOX instead.

The function has been updated to use the message box utility from David Blankenship if RADIOCHK.exe is in the VOL002 directory

With version 4.2 the function FNWAITWIN and rel;ated functions FNWAITMSG and FNWAITBAR are much more flexible and provde a Windows look message box with custom buttons, a progress bar and optionsl message flashing across the wait window as processing progresses.

===FNHELP - open a tip box associated with a screen using a text file===
