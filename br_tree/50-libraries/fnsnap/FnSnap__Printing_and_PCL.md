===FNLOADFONT$*50 - Loads a PCL font to printer===

 FNLOADFONT$*50(NUMBER$,FONTCALL$*50;FONT$*100,OUTFILE)

Description|<br>

GENERAL

==Reprinting Reports==
===FNCLEANLOG - part of FNREPRINT used to remove out of date reports===

Reviews a log file of reports available for reprinting.  If no destroy date has been entered a default of 30 days is entered.  If a report delete date has expired FNCLEANLOG will delete the report and update the log to indicate the date of deletion. If a report is marked as deleted and the deletion occurred  more than 7 days ago then the report log entry will be removed.

 FNCLEANLOG(;REPORTLOG)

;Functions used:

;Variables:
{|
|-valign="top"
|width="10%"|**REPORTLOG **||Optional file number for a report log to be processed.  Generally omitted
|-valign="top"
|width="10%"|**LOGNAME$ **||Not entered her, LOGNAME$ has previously been stored as a variable in the library by another function.
|-valign="top"
|}
<br>
;Comments:<br>
This function is generally run by pressing F4 in the reprint reports list box.

===FNOPEN - create a log file for saved reports===

Opens a display file in a specified directory.  The file name is determined as a sequence number with the leading characters specified in FLNM$.  The name of the open file and the number of the open file are returned to the calling program, ready for creating a RAW print file.

 FNOPEN(&FLNM$,&FLPATH$;PRINTDESC$*80,LLEN,PRINTTYPE$,SAVE_DAYS)

;Functions used:

;Variables:
{|
|-valign="top"
|width="10%"|**FLNM$ **||The leading few characters of the file name to be opened.  The function will complete the file name with a sequence number for that type file in the specified path.
|-valign="top"
|width="10%"|**FLPATH$ **||The path, either absolute or relative, where the print file should be created
|-valign="top"
|width="10%"|**PRINTDESC$ **||A description of the file to appear in the REPORTLOG reprint dialog listing
|-valign="top"
|width="10%"|**LLEN **||The length of each line in the display file or zero (0) if EOL=NONE should be used in the open statement
|-valign="top"
|width="10%"|**PRINTTYPE$ **||If omitted "ALL" will be entered meaning the report can be printed to an NWP printer using preview.  Other options are "DIRECT" and "MATRIX" if a specific printer type is required due to character string that are not compatible with NWP.
|-valign="top"
|width="10%"|**SAVE_DAYS **||The number of days a report should be retained for reprinting. If zero (0) is entered no destruction date will be entered, but the first time that FNCLEANLOG is run after the report creation a destroy date of 30 days will be substituted.
|-valign="top"
|}
<br>
;Comments:<br>
To save a report for a long time enter a destroy date number of days significantly in the future such as 365 or 500

===FNMENUACCESS - used in connection with FNREPRINT to determine user permission to reprint a report===

If WORKMENU is being used then FNMENUACCESS checks the permission files to determine if the user has permission to create the report.  If no permission exists to create the report then it cannot be reprinted and is excluded from the detail list of reports available for reprint.

 FNMENUACCESS(MNAME$*10,MSEQ$*3,MPGM$*50)

;Functions used:

;Variables:
{|

|width="10%"|**MNAME$ **||NAme of the menu from which a report was created

|-valign="top"
|width="10%"|**MPGM$ **||The program call in WORKMENU that allowed the report to be created
|-valign="top"
|}
<br>
;Comments:<br>
This function is used by FNREPRINT to determine user rights for reprinting a report.  The variables are all obtained from REPROTLOG.fil and passed to this function to determine whether access should be granted for reprinting.

===FNPRINT - prints a saved report opened using FNOPEN===

Issued immediately after the CLOSE statement of a file opened using FNOPEN to send the stored print file to a specified printer.  Print specification substitutions for the specified printer are performed during this print process for the RAW print file.

|-valign="top"
|width="10%"|**FILNM$ **||The name and path of the stored RAW file to be printed.

|-valign="top"
|}
<br>
;Comments:<br>
FILNM$ is generally shown as filpath$&filnm$, the two variables returned to the calling program by the FNOPEN function

===FNREPRINT - displays a list of available saved reports and prints selected report===

Displays a list of report quantity by month created and allows selection of a month.  The user is then presented with a list of the reports created that month for which permission exists for reprinting.

|-valign="top"
|}
<br>
;Comments:<br>
The signature file is built using a separate utility program names SIGPRN.br.  The signature is taken from the print file created by printing a Word document containing just the signature to an HP6L laser printer driver in print to file mode.  The utility program print a facsimile of the signature as part of the import process.  The facsimile is overlain with reference lines showing where the upper left corner of the print graphic appears.

The signature is limited to one 32000 bit record.  Consequently large or complex signatures or graphics may not be compatible and may need to be made smaller or less compiles in order to work with this particular program.
