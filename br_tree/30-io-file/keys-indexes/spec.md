# Keyed access & the index facility

Building and using index (key) files for fast record access by key value. The OPEN/READ/REWRITE
statements are in [statements](../statements/spec.md); access-method concepts in
[file-model](../file-model/spec.md); record layout in [form-spec](../form-spec/spec.md).

<a id="semantics"></a>
## Semantics

### How it works
An **index/key file** holds each master record's **key value** plus its **relative record number**
(binary `B 4`). To fetch by key, BR binary-searches the index, gets the record number, and jumps
straight to the master record — no sequential scan. Reading a keyed file **without** a `KEY=`
clause returns records **in key order** (a free sort).

- **Key field**: up to **6 non-contiguous sections** (a *split key*), **≤128 bytes** total.
- **Index types**: **Btree** (default, self-maintaining), Btree2 (`OPTION 22`, ~25–35% faster shared
  I/O, `BTREE_VERIFY <master>[ OFF]` audits structure after each index-altering op), ISAM
  (`OPTION 5 = 4`). **BR won't mix Btree index types within related files** — multiple opens of one
  master with different-type indexes are rejected.
- **Primary vs overflow area**: `INDEX … REORG` sorts the overflow (recently added/changed) into
  the sorted primary area.

<a id="index"></a>
### INDEX command (create/rebuild)
```bnf
INDEX <master-file> <key-file> <key-positions> <key-lengths> [<work-path>]
      [REPLACE] [REORG] [VERIFY] [DUPKEYS] [LISTDUPKEYS] [BADKEYS] [LISTBADKEYS]
      [ '>' <output-file> ] [NATIVE]
```
- Positions/lengths use `/` to separate up to 6 sections; append **`Y`** for `BASEYEAR` (Y2K)
  date handling (`23Y`; for binary date fields `2BY`).
- `REPLACE` rebuilds; `VERIFY` audits a Btree2 index; `DUPKEYS`/`LISTDUPKEYS` and
  `BADKEYS`/`LISTBADKEYS` control duplicate/invalid-key handling (`BADKEYS` = Y2K/baseyear keys whose
  master field holds non-numeric data; with both, bad keys list before dup keys); `>file` redirects
  the list. Parameters may be separated by **spaces or commas**; key fields **may overlap**.
- `REORG` reorganizes the index directly (no master read) — fast, since the already-sorted part is
  skipped. It does **not add new records** (keep the overflow current by opening the index whenever
  you write the master). It **fully rebuilds** only when the index is absent, isn't an index file,
  or the stored key positions/lengths differ from those given.
- `INDEX` performs an implicit `CLEAR` (unless a program is active), runs from READY mode / a
  procedure / `EXECUTE`, can be interrupted with `Ctrl-A` and resumed with `GO`; `-N` suppresses the
  action log.

### Opening for keyed access
```business-rules
! existing keyed file (no RECL/KPS/KLN)
00500 OPEN #5: "NAME=ACCT.INT,KFNAME=ACCT.KEY", INTERNAL, INPUT, KEYED
! new keyed file (include RECL, KPS, KLN)
00100 OPEN #1: "NAME=ACCT.INT,RECL=31,KFNAME=ACCT.KEY,KPS=1,KLN=4", INTERNAL, OUTIN, KEYED
```
A master file may have **multiple index files** (different `KFNAME`, different channels, same
master name; consistent share params).

<a id="key-clause"></a>
### KEY vs SEARCH
| Clause | Match |
|---|---|
| `KEY=k$` | exact; `k$` length must equal `KLN` (else error 0718); `NOKEY` if absent |
| `KEY>=k$` | exact, else next-higher key |
| `SEARCH=k$` | partial (leading substring) allowed |
| `SEARCH>=k$` | partial, else next-higher |

<a id="keyed-io"></a>
### Keyed I/O
- `READ #n, KEY=k$: … NOKEY <ref>` — fetch by key.
- `RESTORE #n, KEY>=k$:` / `SEARCH>=…` — position for a sequential keyed scan.
- `REWRITE` without `KEY=` updates the last record read (fast); with `KEY=` it searches first
  (slower). **Changing the key field value is allowed** — BR automatically updates all related key
  files opened as a group (the old error 0059 is deprecated).
- `DELETE #n, KEY=k$:` — only `KEY=` is allowed (not `>=`/`SEARCH`).
- **`READ #n, KEYONLY: key$, recnum`** reads the key + relative record number from the index
  **without** touching the master record (faster sequential key scans; returns the key when the
  master record is locked). Valid only for `INPUT KEYED`/`OUTIN KEYED`; a master record must have
  been read first (else error 0718); use `FORM` of key length + `B 4`; it moves the master pointer
  but a following `REREAD`/`DELETE`/`REWRITE` errors. Keep the key file current or it may return a
  stale record number.
- **Functions**: `KPS(n)`, `KLN(n)`, `KREC(n)` — key start position, key length, and last *index*-file
  record accessed; all return `-1` if the file isn't open keyed. `KLN(n,seg)` (and `KPS(n,seg)`) give a
  **split-key section's** length/position — `seg=0` (or omitted) is the *total* combined length, a
  too-large `seg` returns `-1`. **`KREC(n)` is the last record in the *index/key* file, not the master**
  (that's `REC(n)`); for a **display** file it's instead the line counter since the last `NEWPAGE`
  (same as `LINES(n)`; `NEWPAGE;` with a trailing `;` suppresses the reset). In a **linked** file
  `KREC` tracks an *anchor* record only when `REC=<anchor>` is processed or an anchor is read/written/
  deleted; `RESTORE REC=<non-anchor>` sets it to 0.

<a id="duplicates"></a>
### Duplicate keys
All `KEY=` forms return the **first** match (lowest record number); read sequentially to walk the
rest, stopping when the key changes:
```business-rules
00100 READ #1, KEY="JONES": NAME$, ADDR$, AMOUNT
00110 DO
00120   READ #1: NAME2$, ADDR2$, AMT2 EOF DONE
00130   IF NAME2$ <> "JONES" THEN EXIT DO
00140   ! process duplicate
00150 LOOP
```

## Tables — error codes
| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 4272 | NOKEY — key not found |
| 0718 | key string length mismatch |
| 0059 | *(deprecated, 2.x only)* attempt to change key field value — changing a key is now allowed |
| 7603 | duplicate keys found (warning) |
| 7611 | key file already exists (no `REPLACE`) |
