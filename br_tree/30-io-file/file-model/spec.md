# File model (types, access, sharing)

The concepts behind BR file I/O: file types, usage modes, access methods, file numbers, and
multi-user sharing/locking. The statements that act on files are in
[statements](../statements/spec.md); record layout is [form-spec](../form-spec/spec.md); keyed
access is [keys-indexes](../keys-indexes/spec.md).

## Semantics

<a id="file-types"></a>
### File types
| Type | Format | Access | Modes | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Internal** | binary, fixed-length records | SEQUENTIAL / RELATIVE / KEYED | INPUT / OUTPUT / OUTIN | most efficient; supports SORT/INDEX, in-place update/delete (`.int`,`.dat`) |
| **Display** | human-readable ASCII | SEQUENTIAL only | INPUT / OUTPUT (not OUTIN) | viewable via `TYPE`; uses PRINT/INPUT/LINPUT (`.txt`,`.dis`) |
| **External** | various | SEQUENTIAL / RELATIVE | INPUT / OUTPUT / OUTIN | foreign formats / data streams |

**Display-file specifics.** Display files (`.txt`/`.dis`) hold BR's own procedures, source programs and
`BRConfig.sys` as well as report/printer output. Records are **variable-length** with an optional
programmer-set delimiter (OPEN `EOL=`); the default record length is **132** (matching wide-carriage
printers). Record length doesn't limit *input* — a string longer than the record can be read if its
variable is dimensioned big enough — but on **output** a string longer than the record length is split
into 132-char (or `RECL=`) records. No formatted I/O: input is `INPUT`/`LINPUT`, output is `PRINT`.
They can't be BR-indexed or built-in-sorted, but `AIDX`/`DIDX` in a `MAT` can sort on them; view one
with the `TYPE` command. `OUTIN` is unsupported except on communications files.

<a id="usage-modes"></a>
### Usage modes
- **INPUT** — read only (File → program); READ, REREAD.
- **OUTPUT** — write new data (program → File); WRITE. Creates/overwrites; pointer at end (append).
- **OUTIN** — read + modify in place (internal files only); READ/REREAD/WRITE/REWRITE/DELETE.

<a id="access-methods"></a>
### Access methods (internal files)
- **Sequential** — records in stored order; pointer moves front→back (default).
- **Relative** — direct access by record number (`REC=`); internal only. (`RELATIVE`/`ABSOLUTE` *also*
  appear in `OPEN` *window* statements to qualify SROW/SCOL — that screen sense is in
  [20-io-screen/windows-cursor](../../20-io-screen/windows-cursor/spec.md), not here.)
- **Keyed** — access by key field value (exact or next-higher); internal only — see
  [keys-indexes](../keys-indexes/spec.md).

The **`REC(n)`/`LREC(n)`** functions report the last-processed and last record numbers (handy for a
running `PRINT REC(n);"of";LREC(n)` counter). `REC(n)` returns **−1** if the channel isn't open, and for
**external** files returns the *byte* number when the last I/O used `POS=` instead of `REC=`. Using
`REC` *inside* an I/O statement is discouraged on multi-user systems.

Statement availability by mode:

| Statement | INPUT | OUTPUT | OUTIN |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| READ / REREAD | ✓ | | ✓ |
| WRITE | | ✓ | ✓ |
| REWRITE / DELETE | | | ✓ |
| RESTORE | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

### Records & fields
A **record** is a line of related information made of **fields** (programmer-defined length and
placement, numeric or character, no limit on count). Plan the layout — field types, lengths,
positions, total record length — before creating an internal file; describe it with a
[FORM](../form-spec/spec.md).

<a id="file-numbers"></a>
### File numbers (channels)
Per the OPEN grammar, channels are `0–200 | 253 | 255 | 300–999`. Reserved: **#0** = main
console/screen (pre-opened), **#255** = default printer (implicit open on first use). The rest are
user files. Channels **300–999** were added in **4.14**; #255 is the printer by convention, not
exclusively.

<a id="file-ref"></a>
### File references & OPEN parameters
A **file-ref** is the full specification of a file wherever the grammar calls for one:
`[<drive>:][<path>]<name>[.<ext>]` — defaults are the current drive, the default directory and a null
extension, so only the name is strictly required. A legacy System/23 form
`<name>[.<ext>][//<drive-name>|/<subdir>][/<drive-number>]` is accepted for converted code only. The
`SAVE`/`OPEN` dialog keywords may stand in for a file-ref to pop the standard Windows Save/Open picker.

Two OPEN parameters that belong to the file model itself:
- **`NEW`** — create the file; if a file of that name already exists the OPEN fails with **error 4150**.
- **`RECL=<n>`** — record length; **required when creating** a file but **never given for an existing
  internal file** (BR stores it in the file's header record). Efficient internal lengths are `2^N−1`
  (table below); `RLN(n)` returns the current record length.

<a id="sharing"></a>
### Multi-user sharing (share-spec)
BR runs identically on **centralized** (Unix/Linux — one shared CPU) and **distributed** (networked
PCs — a CPU per station) multi-user systems; the difference is throughput and cost, not semantics, so
the same sharing/locking code works on both. The share-spec governs whether **other** OPENs may access
the file — it does *not* restrict the current OPEN's own I/O level — and closing the file releases its
share restrictions. Code these even in single-user programs (it's far cheaper than retrofitting later).
- **NOSHR** — exclusive (default when no share-spec is given); no other open permitted (own workstation
  too, except multiple indexes). Use it for batch updates, record purges and temp work files.
- **SHRI** — others may open **INPUT only** (good during batch update / SORT).
- **SHR** — full sharing; records lock individually during OUTIN update. Conflicts raise
  **error 4148**.

<a id="locking"></a>
### Record & file-name locking
- With `SHR,OUTIN`, a record **locks automatically on READ** and stays locked until another record
  is read, it is rewritten, `RELEASE`/`RESTORE` is used, or the file closes.
- `RESERVE` keeps existing locks while reading more records (multi-record updates; must be repeated
  on each I/O); `RELEASE` reads without locking / drops locks. `WAIT=<seconds>` (default 15) before
  **error 0061** on a locked record.
- **Lock zone & file size** — BR locks not the record itself but a byte in a reserved zone keyed to the
  record number (so locking works on growing files and lets `ODBC`/report writers read locked records).
  That zone caps the lockable file size: [`OPTION 33`](../../00-configuration/config-directives/OPTION_(Config).md)
  selects `30` = 1 GB, `31` = 2 GB (default), `32` = 4 GB, or `64` = 64-bit locking for larger files.
- **File-name locking** — the `PROTECT` command takes one of four parameters: **`RESERVE`** (deny others
  any access to the full pathname — BR checks an internal reservation table before *every* OPEN and
  returns **error 4148** *without touching the disk*), **`READ`** (others may read but not change it;
  file must exist — write-protect), **`WRITE`** (lift read-only; all may read and write), and
  **`RELEASE`** (drop this workstation's reservation — only the originating workstation may release).
  The OPEN `RESERVE` parameter reserves a name the same way; release it with `PROTECT name,RELEASE` or
  `CLOSE #n,RELEASE`. A name can be reserved even for a file that doesn't exist (or after `FREE`),
  enabling safe copy/rename/reindex sequences. *(Caveat: on the IBM Network, RESERVE/RELEASE only
  verify a record is free — they don't actually reserve it, so RELEASE has no effect there.)*

<a id="linked"></a>
### Linked files (OPEN … LINKED)
An internal file opened **`LINKED`** holds one or more **linked lists** of records — useful to
attach a group of records to a master record (e.g. notes per customer) when access is only ever
*through* that master. Often **2–3× faster than indexed** files with less overhead, performance
doesn't degrade with size, and records can be inserted anywhere. Each linked record reserves its
**first 8 bytes** for two `BH 4` pointers — **next** (positions 1–4, `0` = last) and **previous**
(positions 5–8) — maintained by BR; don't overwrite them (read with `FORM 2*BH 4` if needed). The
list head is the [Anchor_Record](Anchor_Record.md). Drawbacks: corrupted lists are hard to rebuild,
and insertion order isn't recoverable.

<a id="wsid"></a>
### Workstation ID
`[WSID]` in a filename is replaced with the workstation's unique ID (`WORK[WSID]`); the `WSID$`
function returns it as a string — used to build per-workstation temp/index files. BR treats `[WSID]`
as a special `SUBSTITUTE` default and accepts it in any case, effectively applying
`NAME$ = SREP$(NAME$,1,"[WSID]",WSID$)` to every file reference (all names are upper-cased for
processing); `STATUS` shows the current WSID. It's indispensable when two workstations run the same
program — every temp/output/index name must be unique or one run will fail.

<a id="tables"></a>
## Tables

| RECL tip | value |
|---|---|
| Efficient internal record lengths | `2^N − 1` → 7, 15, 31, 63, 127, 255, 511, 1023 |
| Sharing conflict | error **4148** |
| Locked-record timeout | error **0061** (after `WAIT=`) |

## Examples

```business-rules
! TYPE shows a display file (not internal/binary)
TYPE C:\REPORT.TXT
! Per-workstation temp file name
00100 LET TEMPFILE$ = "WORK" & WSID$ & ".TMP"
```
```business-rules
! Multi-record lock: lock every line of an order, verify stock, update, release all.
00210 READ #3,USING 220,KEY=ITEM$(X),RESERVE: QTY,ALLOC   ! RESERVE keeps prior locks held
00230 IF QTY(X)>QTY-ALLOC THEN RESTORE #3: : GOTO 100      ! out of stock -> drop all locks
00240 ALLOC(X)=ALLOC+QTY(X) : R(X)=REC(3)                  ! save REC for a faster rewrite
00260 REWRITE #3,USING 270,REC=R(X),RESERVE: ALLOC(X)
00290 RESTORE #3:                                          ! release ALL record locks
```
```business-rules
! Graceful file-lockout recovery (record/file already locked -> error 4148)
00100 OPEN #1: "NAME=...",INTERNAL,OUTIN,SHR  IOERR CONFLICT
00500 CONFLICT: IF ERR=4148 THEN PRINT "File in use - <CR> retry, F10 quit" ELSE 510
00510 LINPUT X$ : IF CMDKEY=10 THEN STOP ELSE RETRY
```
