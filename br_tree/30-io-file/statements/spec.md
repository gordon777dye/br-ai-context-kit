status: 2b           # reference base verified comprehensive; misfiled command pages relocated; added 2026-07-03: CLOSE trailing-colon terminates the statement (second colon needed before a following statement); no conflicts
recovered-fold: LINPUT, OPEN_DISPLAY, OPEN_external, READ(disambig), REREAD, RESTORE(disambig), RESTORE_file (7 redirect-collision pages folded from re-fetched source — external short-record 4271, DELETE-invalid-on-external, TRANSLATE/0608/4146, RESTORE modes+linked anchors, LINPUT/WAIT/TIMEOUT, REREAD dup-key idiom; verbatim retained on the BR wiki)
related: [file-model, form-spec, keys-indexes, serial-comm]
keywords: [OPEN, CLOSE, READ, WRITE, REWRITE, DELETE, RESTORE, REREAD, REC, KEY, "LINK=", KEYONLY, FIRST, LAST, PRIOR, NEXT, SAME, EOF, NOKEY, NOREC, OUTIN, SEQUENTIAL, OUTPUT, WAIT, DROP, FREE]
corrections:
  - "The exit clauses were enumerated per statement and are one repeatable production. Section io gave READ `[EOF] [NOKEY] [NOREC] [ERROR]` and REWRITE `[NOKEY] [NOREC]`, which reads as the admissible set for each statement and is not: BR matches an exit clause by a table lookup (`getExit`, command4.cpp) rather than against an expected keyword, so any of the 17 error conditions is admissible wherever a statement's syntax tree admits exits, and they repeat with a space rather than a comma. Replaced with an `<exits>` production pointing at the roster in 10-language/flow-control/error-handling, keeping the per-statement note about which conditions can actually fire - that part was the useful content and is a semantic claim, not a grammatical one. DELETE and RESTORE already used `[ <error-condition> ]`, a third notation for the same thing, and now use `<exits>` too. This spec's enumeration is where brls transcribed a 14-name roster from, which is how the error was found; see lsp/brls/LSP_PLAN.md finding 33. Sources are level 1: BR's `synexits`/`table4v`/`table4k` and the READ/REWRITE trees in `lsp/syn.txt`. Added in brls phase 7."
  - "`USING` was given as taking a `<line-ref>` only, on all four record-I/O statements. BR's syntax tree gives each of READ, REREAD, WRITE and REWRITE a **two-way branch** there — a line reference or an alpha expression — exactly as PRINT has, so `READ #1, USING \"FORM C 20,N 6.2\": A$, B` and `USING F$` are as legal as naming a FORM line, and the inline string is not a PRINT-only convenience. A `<form-ref>` production added, with a note that the two forms differ in *when* the layout is compiled and so in what a mistake in it costs. Source is level 1: the USING nodes in all five statements' trees in `lsp/syn.txt`. The printing spec already had this right. Added in brls phase 10."
  - "KEYONLY documented on READ. It reads the key and relative record number from the index instead of the master record, and the kit already described that behaviour on keys-indexes; what was missing was the statement side - READ's own production did not admit it, so the one page that documented it did not say which statement takes it, the same misfiling LINK= had. Two rules come from command5.cpp's syntaxfn: it is accepted on READ alone (the routine tests `table3v[opsub] != READ_PRI` and abandons the match otherwise) and the colon must follow it (it skips spaces past the word and requires `:`, else backing out to try KEY= - BR's own comment is `/* may be KEY=, etc. */`). KEYONLY is in none of BR's six keyword tables, which is why no keyword list here carries it: positioning keywords behind a special-syntax branch are matched against command5's private sec_kw[] array, not table4k, so syn.txt renders that operand by a lookup BR never performs and prints KEYED. Removed in the same pass, from the REWRITE production: `[ ',' 'WAIT=' <integer> ]` with the note \"WAIT= only with REC=/KEY=\". BR's rewrite[] array in synbc.cpp carries USING, POS=, KEY=, LINK=, REC=, the positional five, RESERVE and RELEASE and no wait keyword in either spelling, and the form is written 0 times in the reference corpus. dev/statement-semantics.md carried the same claim and lost it too - correcting one and not the other is the defect finding 40 is about. Found in brls phase 15; see lsp/brls/LSP_PLAN.md finding 41."
  - "LINK= folded in, and the positioning sets corrected per statement. LINK= was the last clause keyword in BR's tables with no spec at all: the only kit page that mentioned it was the retained deep page file-model/LINKED.md, which describes it as a READ parameter, so the statements that take it were documented here and the parameter itself was reachable from nowhere - the same misfiling as the MAT sub-array operator in brls phase 12. Level 1 gives more than that page does. LINK= is a *positioning* parameter in BR's own grouping: command5.cpp's sec_kw[] lists it beside PRIOR/LAST/KEYONLY/FIRST/NEXT/SAME, and primop1.cpp dispatches it in the same switch as REC=/KEY=/SEARCH=, so it belongs in the <position> production rather than in a clause of its own. Four statements admit it, not one - READ, RESTORE, REWRITE and DELETE, from their syn.txt trees. Its three rules come from primop1.cpp's GETKEY guard `(!g_ufcbcur || (ufmode < ACCESSTYPE_KEYED && !uflinked) || (uflinked && workx >= 0)) return BRENOTKEYED`, where workx is 1 for KEY=, 0 for SEARCH= and -1 for LINK=: the file must be opened LINKED or KEYED (else 0702); on a LINKED file LINK= is the only one of the three accepted, because KEY= and SEARCH= hit the `uflinked && workx >= 0` arm (0702); and since workx = -1 is truthy in C, LINK= takes the KEY length branch `blen != ftotalkeylen` rather than the SEARCH prefix branch, so the string must be the exact total key length (0718). 4282 for a data mismatch was already on its own error page and nothing linked to it. Also corrected in the same production, from the trees and confirmed against two corpora: REWRITE and DELETE admit the positional five and LINK= as well as REC=/KEY= - the spec allowed only REC=/KEY= - but not KEY>= or SEARCH=/SEARCH>=, which is a real asymmetry and now a separate <update-position> production; and WRITE admits REC=, which the spec omitted entirely (257 uses in the second corpus, 24 in the reference corpus). The reference corpus alone would have left the REWRITE/DELETE question open - it writes neither form - and a second corpus settled it with `DELETE ..., LAST` and `REWRITE ..., SAME`. LINK= itself is written 0 times in either corpus, which is why nobody had missed it; that is not the non-functional-form pattern of finding 32, since it has a live runtime handler and its own error pages - these two codebases simply do not use LINKED files. Found in brls phase 13, as the one source-side entry its routing pass could not close. See lsp/brls/LSP_PLAN.md finding 38."
  - "Twelve keywords added. The spec's own BNF defines the <position> production (FIRST/LAST/PRIOR/NEXT/SAME), the I/O exit clauses (EOF/NOKEY/NOREC), the OPEN modes OUTIN/SEQUENTIAL/OUTPUT and the WAIT= clause, and Positional_Parameters.md sits beside it covering the positional five in detail - but the frontmatter declared none of them. The keyword index is built from this list, so all twelve routed to no spec at all: BR's own record-positioning vocabulary was documented here and reachable from nowhere. Only single-sense spellings were added, plus NEXT. DROP, FREE and INPUT are also defined in this BNF and still omitted, because each also names a command or a statement and a class-blind index would attach this spec to that sense too."

# File I/O statements

Opening internal files and reading/writing/updating records. Concepts (types, modes, access,
locking) are in [file-model](../file-model/spec.md); record layout in
[form-spec](../form-spec/spec.md); keyed access (`KEY=`/`SEARCH=`) in
[keys-indexes](../keys-indexes/spec.md). Display-file `PRINT`/`INPUT`/`LINPUT` and printer/serial
opens are cross-referenced below.

<exits>    ::= [ <error-condition> <line-ref> ]*   -- space-separated, repeatable, any of the 17
```

**`USING` takes either form on all four statements.** BR's syntax tree gives each of them a two-way
branch — a line reference, or an alpha expression — so the inline string is not a `PRINT`-only
convenience: `READ #1, USING "FORM C 20,N 6.2": A$, B` is as legal as naming a `FORM` line, and so is
`USING F$` with the layout held in a variable. The two are **not** interchangeable in one respect,
which is when the layout gets compiled and therefore what a mistake in it costs — see
[form-spec](../form-spec/spec.md#when-a-form-is-compiled).

<a id="positioning-per-statement"></a>
**Positioning is not the same set on every statement**, and BR's own syntax trees are what say so:

| statement | admits |
|---|---|
| `READ` | the full `<position>`, plus `KEYONLY` — see below |
| `RESTORE` | the full `<position>` |
| `REWRITE`, `DELETE` | `<update-position>` — no `KEY>=`, no `SEARCH=`/`SEARCH>=`, because an update has to name one record and not the next-greater one |
| `WRITE` | `REC=` only |
| `REREAD` | none — it re-decodes the buffered record and never moves |

The positional five are easy to overlook on `REWRITE` and `DELETE` because `REC=` and `KEY=` are what
almost everyone writes, but they are admitted and they are used: real code writes `DELETE #n, LAST:`
and `REWRITE #n, SAME:`. **`NEXT` on a `READ` is not a repositioning** — `primop1.cpp` special-cases
it to plain sequential access (`sd.atype = 0`) where every other statement records it as a position.

**`<exits>` is one production, not a per-statement list.** BR matches an exit clause by a table
lookup rather than against an expected keyword, so **any** of the 17 error conditions is admissible
wherever a statement admits exits at all — the roster and the ordering rule are in
[10-language/flow-control/error-handling](../../10-language/flow-control/error-handling/spec.md#conditions).
Which of them can actually *fire* is per statement: `EOF`, `NOKEY`, `NOREC` and `ERROR` are the ones
that matter on a `READ`, `NOKEY` and `NOREC` on a `REWRITE`.

<a id="semantics"></a>
## Semantics

- **OPEN defaults** (internal): reuse existing file (not create), not keyed, `NOSHR`, `WAIT=15`,
  `SEQUENTIAL`. Include `RECL`/`KPS`/`KLN` **only when creating**; never on an existing file
  (they live in the header). `NEW` errors (4150) if the file exists; `USE` opens-or-creates;
  `REPLACE` overwrites.
- **`TRANSLATE=<table>`** names a 256- or 512-byte character-translation file applied to all
  `C`/`V`/`G`/`N`/`ZD`/`PIC` I/O (first 256 bytes = input table; an optional second 256 = output table,
  else BR inverts the input table). **`WAIT=`** also governs how long an `OPEN` waits for a file another
  workstation has locked before **error 4146** (previously it affected only locked *records* → error
  0061). When a file is opened both `OUTIN` and `INPUT`, the **`OUTIN` open must come first** or you get
  **error 0608**.
- <a id="external"></a>**External files** (`OPEN … EXTERNAL`) read/write *any* bytes of *any* file (no BR
  header, no delete byte) — so **`DELETE` is invalid** on them. Position with `REC=` (record × `RECL`) or
  `POS=` (absolute byte); don't mix the two on one file. `EOF` fires only when the final record is a full
  `RECL`; a **short** final record raises **error 4271** (trap with `IOERR`) with `CNT` = bytes read and
  the record null-padded — a following `REREAD` retrieves the padded record, after which reads give the
  normal `4270` EOF. For an external RELATIVE file last positioned with `POS=`, `REC(n)`/`LREC(n)` return
  a *byte* number rather than a record number.
- <a id="display"></a>**Display files** (`OPEN … DISPLAY`) open a text file or a printer for `INPUT` *or*
  `OUTPUT` (never `OUTIN`), sequential only; defaults add `PAGEOFLOW` 60 lines and `EOL=` CRLF (DOS) / LF
  (Unix). Print-side parameters (`EOL=`, `PAGEOFLOW=`, `COPIES=`, `PRINTER=`, `CONV=`, `RETRY=`) are in
  [40-io-printing/statements](../../40-io-printing/statements/spec.md); `OPEN #0:` (re)sizes the BR main
  window and sets `BUTTONROWS`.
- <a id="read"></a>**READ** pulls the next record (or the one at `REC=`/`KEY=`) into the variable
  list via a `USING` [FORM](../form-spec/spec.md). `EOF` handles end-of-file.
- <a id="rewrite"></a>**REREAD** re-decodes the buffered current record (no file I/O, no `EOF`) —
  handy to re-interpret fields. It must follow a successful `READ`/`REREAD` and takes **no**
  `REC=`/`POS=`/`KEY=` clause; a common idiom reads a *key-only* FORM, tests the key, then `REREAD`s the
  *full* FORM (e.g. to walk duplicate keys). **REWRITE** updates the last record read (file must be
  `OUTIN`); it changes only the fields the FORM names, leaving the rest intact. When REWRITE
  **repositions** via `REC=`/`KEY=`, `WAIT=<sec>` bounds how long to wait for a record another
  workstation has locked before **error 0061** (default 15s); `WAIT=` is meaningless on a plain
  REWRITE of the already-locked current record.
- <a id="linput"></a>**LINPUT** reads an entire line/record into **one** string variable, keeping
  commas, quotes and leading blanks (unlike `INPUT`, which splits on commas) — from the keyboard
  (`#0`/none), a display/communications file, or a procedure file under `RUN PROC`. `WAIT=<sec>` arms
  a `TIMEOUT` trap (**error 4145**; `WAIT=0` = no wait,
  `WAIT=-1` = wait forever, reset on each keypress). LINPUT targets a **single** string variable — it
  **cannot** read into a string `MAT` (unlike `INPUT`, which can fill an array); read multiple lines by
  looping LINPUT (trap `EOF` when the file runs out). `RECL` doesn't limit input (it governs output only).
  On a **DISPLAY** open only (a display or `FORMAT=ASYNC` communications file — never INTERNAL/EXTERNAL),
  the open's `EOL=` governs how `LINPUT` delimits input: `EOL=NONE` reads to the variable's dimensioned
  length (one byte at a time if `DIM X$*1`); `EOL=CRLF`/`LF` accepts and strips the delimiter. This
  affects `LINPUT`, **not** the plain `INPUT` statement.
- <a id="write"></a>**WRITE** appends a new record (or writes at `REC=` if that slot is
  deleted/new — else `DUPREC`).
- <a id="delete"></a>**DELETE** removes the last record read, or the one at `REC=`/`KEY=`; space
  is **not** reclaimed automatically (use `COPY -D`).
- <a id="restore"></a>**RESTORE** repositions the file pointer. With no clause it goes to the **start**
  — and **drops all data** on a file opened `DISPLAY OUTPUT` or `…OUTPUT SEQUENTIAL`, and **errors** on
  `OUTPUT RELATIVE`/`OUTPUT KEYED`. Clauses: `REC=` (RELATIVE record), `KEY=`/`SEARCH=` (KEYED, exact or
  `>=` next-greater), `POS=` (external RELATIVE byte); plus positional `FIRST`/`LAST`/`PRIOR`/`NEXT`/
  `SAME`. In a **linked** file, `RESTORE …,REC=<anchor>` repositions to a list (and sets `KREC`), while
  bare `RESTORE` (or `REC=0`) starts a *new* anchor for insertion. RESTORE's channel must be a valid
  file-channel number (`1–199` or `300–999`). By default RESTORE **releases all record locks** held on
  the channel; **`,RESERVE`** keeps them and **`,RELEASE`** releases them explicitly. (To *merely*
  release record locks, `REREAD #n: RELEASE` is faster than `RESTORE #n:`.)
- <a id="link"></a>**`LINK=<string-expr>`** verifies that a linked record belongs to the master you
  think it does. Admitted on `READ`, `RESTORE`, `REWRITE` and `DELETE`, and it is a **positioning
  parameter** in BR's own grouping — `command5.cpp` lists it beside `FIRST`/`LAST`/`PRIOR`/`SAME`, and
  the runtime dispatches it in the same switch as `REC=`/`KEY=`/`SEARCH=`. Three rules, all enforced
  before any I/O happens:
  - **The file must be opened `LINKED`** (or `KEYED`), else **error 0702**.
  - **On a `LINKED` file, `LINK=` is the *only* one of the three key parameters accepted** — `KEY=` and
    `SEARCH=` there answer **0702** as well. This is the one place the `<position>` production is
    misleading if read as a menu: which member is legal depends on how the file was opened.
  - **The string must be exactly the total key length** (`KPS=`/`KLN=` as given on the creating
    `OPEN`), not a prefix — so it behaves like `KEY=` and not like `SEARCH=`. A wrong length is
    **error 0718**.

  Data that does not match at read time is **error 4282**, which also covers operating-system error 82,
  so check the `LINK=` string before assuming a disk problem. Linked-file structure — anchor records,
  the next/previous pointers in positions 1–8, and what `RESTORE` and `KREC` do with them — is on the
  deep page [LINKED](../file-model/LINKED.md).
- <a id="keyonly"></a>**`KEYONLY` reads the key instead of the record.** `READ #n, KEYONLY: key$, recnum`
  takes the key and its relative record number straight from the **index**, without touching the master
  record — so a sequential key scan costs one file's worth of I/O rather than two, and a key still comes
  back when the master record is locked. What it returns, the `FORM` it needs (key length plus `B 4`),
  the requirement that a master record have been read first, and why a following
  `REREAD`/`REWRITE`/`DELETE` errors are on [keys-indexes](../keys-indexes/spec.md#keyonly), which owns
  the index side. Two rules belong here, with the statement:
  - **`READ` only.** `syntaxfn` (`command5.cpp`) tests `table3v[opsub] != READ_PRI` and abandons the
    match otherwise, so `RESTORE`/`REWRITE`/`DELETE` do not take it even though they share the same
    positioning routine.
  - **The colon must follow it.** The same routine skips spaces past the word and requires `:` next;
    anything else and BR backs out and re-reads the token as `KEY=`, which is its own comment on why
    (`/* may be KEY=, etc. */`).

  **`KEYONLY` is in none of BR's keyword tables**, which is why it appears in no keyword list in this
  reference and why `syn.txt` prints `KEYED` in its place. Positioning keywords reached through a
  special-syntax branch are matched against `command5`'s own `sec_kw[]` array rather than the clause
  table, so `table4k` never needed an entry. See lsp/brls/LSP_PLAN.md finding 41.
- <a id="close"></a>**CLOSE** options (both require the file opened `NOSHR`): **`DROP`** empties the
  file's *contents* — the file remains (internal files keep only the header record, all space freed);
  **`FREE`** *erases* the file from the system. A trailing **`,RELEASE`** also releases the file's
  **name reservation** (a filename reserved via `PROTECT`/OPEN becomes available to others again). (These
  are the statement parameters; the same-named
  `DROP`/`FREE` **commands** do the equivalent from the console —
  [70-commands/file-directory](../../70-commands/file-directory/spec.md).) Files auto-close at program
  end (unless `NOCLOSE`). **The trailing `:` terminates the statement** — to code another statement
  after `CLOSE` on the same physical line, add a *second* colon as the separator: `CLOSE #n: : STOP`
  (a single `CLOSE #n: STOP` folds the following statement into the CLOSE and misfires).

<a id="rec"></a>
### Relative access — `REC=`
`REC=<numeric-expr>` selects a record by 1-based position (any numeric expression; non-integers
are truncated). Available on all I/O except `REREAD`. Position clauses need **not** be the last
clause before the `:` — they may appear in any order among the statement's clauses.
Missing/deleted target → `NOREC`.
