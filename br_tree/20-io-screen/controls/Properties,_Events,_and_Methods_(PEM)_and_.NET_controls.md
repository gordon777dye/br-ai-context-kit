At the Fall 2008 `Business Rules! Conference`, `Gordon Dye` introduced the capability of `Business Rules!` to use `.NET` controls as an interactive part of any BR window. 

This provides for extending Business Rules!, using graphically appealing controls that are unavailable in BR, and possibly overcoming some of its limitations.

== System Requirements ==
**BR Version:** BR `4.2` or later.

**Windows components:**

#Windows 2000, or later.
##For Windows 2000, install Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0. Link: [ftp://ftp.brulescorp.com/Dll_Distr/pem/winstall/dotnetfx20.exe] 
##For Windows XP or later, install Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5. Link: [ftp://ftp.ads.net/Dll_Distr/pem/winstall/dotnetfx35.exe]
#**vcredist_x86.exe** - Link: [ftp://ftp.brulescorp.com/Dll_Distr/pem/winstall/vcredist_x86.exe]

**BR Directory:**

#`pemnet.dll` - acts as the main bridge between .NET and BR. Link: [ftp://ftp.brulescorp.com/Dll_Distr/pemnet.dll]
#`brconvert.dll` - this library converts BR strings and numeric variables to and from .NET data types, such as DateTime. 

This library can be changed to convert BR data to user-defined data types. 

You may get the compiled library here: [ftp://ftp.brulescorp.com/Dll_Distr/pem/br_dir/brconvert.dll] or the source code here: [ftp://ftp.brulescorp.com/Dll_Distr/pem/brconvert]

====Independent Controls====
External controls can now be placed on BR windows. See the following example and parameters:

 PRINT FIELDS "row,col,COMP[ONENT] rows/cols [, INDEPENDENT]": control-id$, mat properties$ [, mat events$]

INDEPENDENT signifies that the control is independently enabled and is not 
subject to the normal enabling restrictions associated with FIELDS operations. 

Control-id$ should be in the format "mycontrol:class-name"

Mat properties$ will have property assignments (e.g. color=blue)

Mat events$ will have event assignments to fkey values (TypChanged=1035)

To clear previous settings use TypChanged= -1

Setting events is optional

The above form cannot be used in the same statement as other controls.

====Other Controls====
The following forms can be used in the same FIELDS array as other controls:
 
 PRINT FIELDS "row,col, COMP [rows/cols]": mat properties$
 INPUT FIELDS "row,col,COMP [rows/cols]": mat properties$

Input Processing:
Mat properties$ has property names or property assignments. Any assigned values will be ignored. The array will be populated with property assignments for all specified properties.

The syntax for retrieving all of the names:

 INPUT FIELDS "row,col,comp[onent] rows/cols,PROPERTY_NAMES,depth": mat properties$

 INPUT FIELDS "row,col,comp[onent] rows/cols,EVENT_NAMES",
mat events$

 INPUT FIELDS "row,col,comp[onent] rows/cols,METHOD_NAMES": mat methods$

To set or get individual properties:

 set$("#fileno,row,col","city=Los Angeles")
 set$("#fileno,row,col","address.city=Los Angeles")
 get$("#fileno,row,col","city")

To invoke a method:
 INVOKE("#fileno,row,col",method-name$, mat args$)

Method_name$ MUST be from the list returned by INPUT ... METHOD_NAMES in its entirety.

Method Name Examples:
 Set_Text(System.String value)

SetBounds(System.Int32 x, System.Int32 y, System.Int32 width, System.Int32 height)

Note- To use Active X controls with PEM, use AXIMP.EXE (from the dot net framework) under XP or later.

== Using Existing .NET controls  ==

.NET controls are contained in a library called **`System.Windows.Forms.dll`**.

To use their public methods and properties, you do not need to write any non-BR code. 

Simply copy 

**C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\System.Windows.Forms.dll**

into your BR directory.

== MonthCalendar Example  ==

**To get PEM examples and source code, download ftp://ftp.brulescorp.com/Dll_Distr/pem_demo/pem_demo.zip**

The MonthCalendar control is contained in System.Windows.Forms.dll.

 00100 PRINT NEWPAGE
 00200 DIM PROPERTIES$(2)*500,ARGUMENTS$(1)*80
 00300 DIM METHODS$(1)*255
 00400 OPEN #0: "rows=40,cols=110",DISPLAY,OUTPUT 
 00500 OPEN #10:  "srow=11,rows=17,scol=20,cols=67,border=S",DISPLAY,OUTPUT 
 00600 PRINT #10, FIELDS "2,11, component 7/16,independent":"System.Windows.Forms:System.Windows.Forms.MonthCalendar", MAT PROPERTIES$
 00700 PRINT #10, FIELDS "11,11,C 6,,B1000" : "Exit"
 00800 DO 
 00900    INPUT FIELDS "14,30,C 1", WAIT=1: DUMMY$ TIMEOUT IGNORE
 01000    Print #10, Fields "13,11,C 50" : Get$("#10,2,11","SelectionRange.Start")
 01100    IF FKEY=1000 THEN EXIT DO 
 01200 LOOP 
 01300 STOP 
 01400 IGNORE: CONTINUE

===PEM Data Conversion===

BR offers only two data types - string and numeric. Many other types are required by various controls available for outside resources. 

Concerning DOT NET and other objects, BR provides conversion routines for the purpose of working with various data types. For example you may express colors as is done in HTML (#xxyyzz) and have them converted to and from a structure  with RGB values for use by a .NET object. 

These conversion routines are in a separate DLL that is automatically invoked based on the field's class type when a property value is sent or received by BR via a properties array, or a GET, SET or INVOKE parameter. The DLL used to perform these conversions is included in the object toolbox DLL group located in the BR directory. 

The first release of the DLL supports the following object types:
 // conversion class for System.Drawing.Color
 // conversion class for System.String
 // conversion class for System.Int32

If there is a class that you would like to see a conversion routine for that does not exist and you wish to write one, this must implement the interface (DLL data type name) brconvert.BrConversion which has 2 methods: 

 int objectToString(System.String string, out System.Object value)
 int stringToObject(System.Object value, out System.String string)

You must also prepend the name of the class with brconvert.BR so if you were going to make a conversion class for System.Drawing.Color the conversion class would need to be named:

 brconvert.BRSystem.Drawing.Color.

===PEM File Required===
BR Directory-
*pemnet.dll
*brconvert.dll
*vcdlltest.exe - used for testing

Windows Dot Net Framework
Use the following files to install the necessary system programs-
*dotnetfx20 (W2K) or dotnetfx35 (XP or Vista) - to install/upgrade dot net
*vcredist_x86.exe - to install a required dot net support library

There are two main groups of supporting Dll's needed to use Dot Net controls with BR:
#VC++ shared libraries.  These can be tested with vcdlltest.exe and 
installed with vcredist_x86.exe.
#The .Net framework.  If you are using Windows 2000, you will need to 
use dotnetfx20.exe.  If you are using windows XP or Vista use dotnetfx35.exe.

== Creating Custom .NET controls with Visual C#  ==

**To get PEM examples and source code, download ftp://ftp.brulescorp.com/Dll_Distr/pem_demo/pem_demo.zip**

If the existing functionality of a given control does not completely meet your needs, then you may **customize** this control's behavior by adding your own code. Suppose you want a MonthCalendar control with event notifications and the ability to add events. For that, you would need to create a control, which **includes** a MonthCalendar **and** other controls and functions which you will use to create your custom Calendar.

**Additional System Requirements:**

Visual C# 2008 http://www.microsoft.com/express/vcsharp/#webInstall

At some point, the installer will ask you whether you’d also like to install Microsoft SQL Server Express. You can install it if you want, but it is not necessary for this presentation.

**Creating a control library**

Game plan: create a control containing a Calendar, an "Add Event" button, combo boxes for hour and minute selection, a text box for entering an event  description, and a timer which will check every 2 seconds whether the user should be notified of an upcoming event.

1) Open Visual C#.

2) Open the File menu and choose **New Project**.

`Image:newProjectIcon.JPG`

3) When the **New Project** dialog pops up, from **Templates** choose **Class Library** and type in the project name you want to use.

`Image:ProjectType.JPG`

4) The following code will be auto generated:

`Image:AutoCode.JPG`

5) In the upper right corner you can find the **Solution Explorer**, which lists all the classes in your project.

`Image:SolutionExplorer.JPG`

6) We will not use Class1, so right – click on it and **Delete**.

7) To add a control to this project, right – click on the project in the **Solution Explorer**, choose **Add**, and then choose **User Control**.
 
`Image:AddControl.JPG`

8) Rename the control from Control1.cs to a meaningful name. I chose **DateTimeControl.cs**.

`Image:RenameNewControl.JPG`
 
9) You should now see a blank control.

`Image:EmptyControl.JPG`

10) Make the control bigger.

`Image:BiggerControl.JPG` 

11) Open the **View** menu and choose **Toolbox**.

`Image:ViewToolbox.JPG`

12) In the **Toolbox**, under **Common Controls**, find **MonthCalendar** and drag it onto your blank control.
 
(before)

`Image:CalendarInToolbox.JPG`

(after)

`Image:CalendarOnControl.JPG`
 
13) Open the **View** menu and choose **Properties** Window.
 
`Image:ViewProperties.JPG`

14) On the right, the **Properties Window** will pop up. Find the **Modifier** property and change its value to **Public**.

`Image:CalendarProperties.JPG`
 
Now we are ready to add our customization.

15) Let's make our control wider and drag a **button** onto it from the **Toolbox**.

(before)

`Image:ButtonInToolbox.JPG`

(after)

`Image:ButtonInControl.JPG`

16) In the **Properties** window, change the **Text** property to **Add Event**.

`Image:AddEventBtn.JPG`

17) Now we'll add 2  **ComboBox** controls.

(before)

`Image:ComboBoxInToolbox.JPG`

(after)

`Image:ComboBoxOnControl.JPG`

18) Now we will give values 0 through 23 to the first ComboBox (HOURS) and values 00 through 59 to the second ComboBox (MINUTES). 

Select the first ComboBox, then press the small arrow in its upper right corner. 

When the **ComboBox Tasks** dialog comes up, press **Edit Items**.

`Image:AddItemsToCombo.JPG`

When the **String Collection Editor** comes up, type in 0 - 23, one per line.

`Image:HourStrings.JPG`

Similarly, give the 2nd ComboBox values 00 - 59.

19) Now let's add a **TextBox** for event description.

(before)

`Image:TextBoxInToolbox.JPG`

(after)

`Image:TextBoxOnControl.JPG`

20) Now we'll add a **Timer**.  

The Timer is **NOT** a component that will be visible on our custom control.

(before)

`Image:TimerInToolbox.JPG`

(after)

`Image:TimerInControl.JPG`

Note that the Timer shows up not on the control, but **BELOW** it. 

Yet the Timer is still **tied** to our CalendarControl.

21) Now **double-click** on the **Add Event** button.

This should generate an **event handler** stub for what happens when this button is clicked while the CalendarControl is running.

`Image:ButtonEventHandler.JPG`

22) Now we are ready to write some **CODE**.

**To get PEM examples and source code, download ftp://ftp.ads.net/Dll_Distr/pem_demo/pem_demo.zip**

Replace the above code with the code below.

This would actually be a very **short** program if all the comments were removed.

`Image:CalendarControlConstructor_.JPG`

`Image:button1Click_.JPG`

`Image:timer1Tick_.JPG`

`Image:CalendarEvent_.JPG`

23) Open the Build menu and choose Build Solution.
 
`Image:BuildSolution.JPG`

24) By default, all your projects are saved in '*My Documents\Visual Studio 2008\Projects* In your Projects directory.

Navigate to **pem_library\pem_library\bin\Release**.
Copy pem_library.dll to the directory where Business Rules resides.

25) The following BR program uses our control:

 00100 PRINT NEWPAGE
 00200 DIM PROPERTIES$(2)*500,ARGUMENTS$(1)*80
 00400 OPEN #0: "rows=40,cols=110",DISPLAY,OUTPUT 
 00500 OPEN #10: "srow=11,rows=17,scol=20,cols=67,border=S,caption=Custom Calendar",DISPLAY,OUTPUT 
 00600 PRINT #10, FIELDS "2,11, component 9/35,independent": "pem_library:pem_library.CalendarControl", MAT PROPERTIES$
 00700 PRINT #10, FIELDS "12,11,C 6,,B1000" : "Exit"
 00800 DO 
 00900    INPUT FIELDS "14,30,C 1", WAIT=3: DUMMY$ TIMEOUT IGNORE
 01100    IF FKEY=1000 THEN EXIT DO 
 01200 LOOP 
 01300 STOP 
 01400 IGNORE: CONTINUE
