corrections:
  - "TRACE added as a statement. BR has a syn.txt tree for it — `TRACE` with three branches, PRINT, OFF and an optional ON — and a primary operation to execute it (TRACE_PRI, primop0.cpp), but the reference documented TRACE only as an option of the RUN and GO *commands*, so the statement form was missing from the tree entirely. It was the one genuinely undocumented statement left in gendata's coverage report. Semantics read from BR's source: primop0.cpp switches on the secondary opcode, where OFF_SEC (0x05) clears RUN_TRACE|RUN_TRACE_PRINT, ON_SEC (0x04) sets RUN_TRACE, and PRINT_SEC (0x06) sets RUN_TRACE_PRINT — the three constants are defined together in basoprcmn.h under the comment `/* trace */`. run.cpp gates the per-line output on RUN_TRACE and picks FILENBR_MAIN_PRINTER (255) over FILENBR_MAINWINDOW (0) on RUN_TRACE_PRINT, printing the line number with L_05ld (`%05i`). That gating is why TRACE PRINT alone traces nothing, and command9.cpp shows the console form guarding the same bit differently. A bare TRACE is left marked unverified rather than assumed equivalent to TRACE ON: command4.cpp stores no operand byte when an optional keyword is absent, so primop0 reads whatever follows the primary op. Added in brls phase 5."
  - "TO and OFF added to the frontmatter keywords. Both are table4k clause keywords this page's own BNF documents — `FOR <v> = <e> TO <e>` and `TRACE {ON|OFF|PRINT}` — and neither was declared, so a reader looking either one up reached nothing. STEP, ON and PRINT, from the same two trees, were declared already; these two were the siblings that got missed. Found in brls phase 13."
  - "A note added under §ON…GOTO/GOSUB that `FKEY`/`FNKEY` used bare or with an operator (`ON FKEY-89
    GOTO A,B`) is this form and not error-handling's `ON FKEY <n> …` condition — the full rule and its
    sourcing are on that page, since it is the condition form's grammar (one target, no repeat) that
    forces the general form to be the only reading whenever a second target follows."

# Loops & branching

Iteration and control transfer: `FOR/NEXT`, `DO/LOOP`, `GOTO`, `GOSUB`/`RETURN`,
`ON … GOTO/GOSUB`, and `EXIT`. The `IF` decision itself is in
[conditionals](../../data-manipulation/conditionals/spec.md); the conditions are in
[expressions](../../data-manipulation/expressions/spec.md). Targets are `<line-ref>`s
(line number or label) — see [syntax](../../syntax/spec.md#line-labels).

<a id="syntax"></a>
## Syntax

```bnf
FOR <num-var> = <num-expr> TO <num-expr> [STEP <num-expr>]
    <statements>
NEXT <num-var>

DO [{WHILE|UNTIL} <condition>]
    <statements>
    [EXIT DO]
LOOP [{WHILE|UNTIL} <condition>]

GOTO  <line-ref>
GOSUB <line-ref>          ... RETURN
ON <num-expr> GOTO  <line-ref> [',' <line-ref>]* [NONE <line-ref>]
ON <num-expr> GOSUB <line-ref> [',' <line-ref>]* [NONE <line-ref>]
EXIT DO                   -- there is no EXIT FOR; leave a FOR loop with GOTO
RANDOMIZE                 -- reseed RND from the system clock
TRACE {ON|OFF|PRINT}      -- line-number tracing, under program control
```

<a id="semantics"></a>
## Semantics

<a id="for-next"></a>
### FOR / NEXT
Counts the loop variable from start to end by `STEP` (default `1`; negative steps count down).
The test happens **before** each pass; the variable **retains its final value** after the loop.
`NEXT` must name the same variable as `FOR`. Loops **nest up to 20 levels** and must be fully
contained (no partial overlap — the inner `NEXT` comes before the outer `NEXT`). Leave early with
`GOTO`.

<a id="do-loop"></a>
### DO / LOOP
Flexible condition loop; the `WHILE`/`UNTIL` test may sit on `DO` (tested first — may run zero
times) or on `LOOP` (tested last — runs **at least once**). No labels needed for the structure;
leave early with `EXIT DO`. `WHILE` continues while true; `UNTIL` continues until true.

<a id="goto"></a>
### GOTO
Unconditional transfer to a `<line-ref>`. Backward jumps form loops; forward jumps skip code.
The target must exist before `SAVE`/`REPLACE`.

<a id="gosub"></a>
### GOSUB / RETURN
Calls a subroutine (a labeled/numbered block ending in `RETURN`); control returns to the line
after the `GOSUB`. The depth of nested GOSUBs is limited by the call stack (`FLOWSTACK`), which is
**configurable** via the BRConfig.sys `FLOWSTACK` directive (default **100**, 4.3+; shared with
user-defined-function returns — see
[config-directives](../../../00-configuration/config-directives/spec.md)); subroutines may call
other subroutines. `GOSUB` **can't run from the command line** (**error 1011**,
illegal immediate statement), and active GOSUBs can't be edited during an interruption; `RETURN`
resumes at the statement after the call even if that's mid-way through a multi-statement line.

<a id="on-goto"></a>
### ON … GOTO / GOSUB
Multi-way branch: the numeric expression is **rounded to the nearest integer** and selects the
*n*-th `<line-ref>` (1 = first). If the value is `< 1` or beyond the list, control goes to the
`NONE` target if present, otherwise falls through to the next line. `ON … GOSUB` returns after the
selected subroutine's `RETURN` (menu dispatch pattern); its `NONE` target is itself a **GOSUB** branch
(the routine there must also `RETURN`), not an error handler, and an `ON … GOSUB` may carry trailing
error-condition clauses.

**`FKEY`/`FNKEY` as the numeric expression** — `ON FKEY-89 GOTO A,B` and `ON FKEY GOTO A,B` are this
form, not [error-handling](../error-handling/spec.md)'s `ON FKEY <n> …` condition, whenever more than
one target follows or nothing/an operator sits where the condition's `<n>` belongs; see that page for
why the two cannot be confused for one another mid-statement.

<a id="exit"></a>
### EXIT
`EXIT DO` terminates the **innermost** `DO`/`LOOP` and continues at the first statement after it.
There is **no `EXIT FOR`** in BR — leave a `FOR`/`NEXT` loop early with `GOTO` (see
[FOR / NEXT](#for-next)).

<a id="randomize"></a>
### RANDOMIZE
Reseeds the `RND` random-number generator from the **system clock** so each run differs. **Without
`RANDOMIZE`, `RND` repeats the same sequence every time BR is loaded.** (`RND` returns 0–1; scale it,
e.g. `INT(RND*100+1)` for 1–100.)

<a id="termination"></a>
### Program termination & interruption
- **`STOP`** halts the program (it can be resumed with `GO` from the console); used to mark the end
  of the main line before subroutines.
- **`END [<num-expr>]`** ends the program, **closes all files**, and sets the [`CODE`](../../data-manipulation/system-functions/spec.md#system-info)
  return value (`END 12` sets `CODE`=12; default 0). `END` is optional — a program auto-ends with
  `CODE`=0.
- **`PAUSE`** interrupts execution so the operator can enter commands / inspect variables; `GO`
  resumes and restores the screen (a handy debugging breakpoint).

<a id="trace"></a>
### TRACE
Turns **line-number tracing** on and off from inside the program, rather than from the console. As
each line executes, BR writes its line number — five digits, zero-padded — to the main window, or
to the system printer when the print destination is selected, and logs a `Trace line <n> in
<program>` event.

| Form | Effect |
|---|---|
| `TRACE ON` | start tracing |
| `TRACE OFF` | stop tracing, and clear the print destination |
| `TRACE PRINT` | send trace output to the printer instead of the window |

`TRACE` is the statement form of the `RUN`/`GO` command options — the same two run flags — so
`TRACE ON` and a console `RUN TRACE` do the same thing, and `TRACE OFF` matches `NOTRACE`. See
[70-commands/information](../../../70-commands/information/spec.md) for the command side. The value
of the statement is that it can bracket **one suspect region** of a long program instead of tracing
the whole run:

```business-rules
02000 TRACE ON
02010 GOSUB POST_LEDGER
02020 TRACE OFF
```

Two things to know before relying on it:

- **`TRACE PRINT` does not start tracing.** It only selects the destination; the trace output is
  still gated on tracing being on, so `TRACE PRINT` on its own produces nothing. Write
  `TRACE ON` as well. (The console form is defensive here where the statement is not: `RUN PRINT`
  sets the destination *only* if tracing is already on, while the statement sets it either way and
  the setting then applies to the next `TRACE ON`.)
- **Write `TRACE ON`, not a bare `TRACE`.** BR's grammar marks the `ON` keyword optional, so a bare
  `TRACE` compiles, but the compiler emits no operand for it and the runtime reads the byte that
  follows the statement instead. What that byte is has not been established, so the effect of a
  bare `TRACE` is unverified — the two-word form is unambiguous.
