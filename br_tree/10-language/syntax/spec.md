# Lexical structure & program syntax

How BR source is written: line numbers, comments, identifiers, line labels, and multiple
statements per line — and [how BR decides what a bare token *is*](#name-resolution), which is by
arity rather than by symbol table and catches most newcomers out. The control statements that
*use* line refs are in [other-flow](../flow-control/other-flow/spec.md) and
[conditionals](../data-manipulation/conditionals/spec.md).

<a id="syntax"></a>
## Syntax

```bnf
<line-number> ::= <integer>                      -- 1 to 99999, required on every line
<comment>     ::= '!'  [ <text-to-end-of-statement> ]
               |  REM  [ <text-to-end-of-line> ]
<identifier>  ::= { <letter> | '_' } { <letter> | <digit> | '_' }*
<line-label>  ::= ' ' <identifier> ':'           -- immediately after the line number
<line-ref>    ::= <line-number> | <line-label>
```

Statement separators: `:` or `!:` join multiple statements on one physical line.

<a id="semantics"></a>
## Semantics

<a id="line-numbers"></a>
### Line numbers
- **Required on every program line**; range **1–99999**; conventionally incremented by 10
  (`100, 110, 120 …`) to leave room for insertions.

### Language-wide lexical rules
- **Case-insensitive** keywords and identifiers (`PRINT` = `pr` = `Print`; `NAME$` = `name$`).
- **Abbreviated keywords** — most statements/commands have short forms (`PRINT` → `PR`); see
  [§Keyword abbreviations](#abbreviations).
- **Implicit typing** — variables need no explicit declaration (created on first use).

<a id="comments"></a>
### Comments — `!` vs `REM`
Both are non-executable and preserve case. They differ in **scope**:
- **`!`** ends at the end of the current **statement**. A later statement on the same line
  (after `:` / `!:`) still runs:
  ```business-rules
  00100 LET X = 5 ! set initial value :LET Y = X * 2   ! Y is still assigned
  ```
- **`REM`** ends at the end of the **line** — everything after it, including `:`-joined
  statements, is comment text:
  ```business-rules
  00200 REM whole line is a comment : LET Y = 5        ! Y is NOT assigned
  ```
- Use `!` for inline comments (by far the most common), `REM` for stand-alone comment lines.

<a id="identifiers"></a>
### Identifiers
1–30 characters; must start with a letter or `_`; may contain letters, digits, `_`;
case-insensitive. (String variables add a trailing `$`.) A name held in the runtime function
tables (`table6k` ∪ `table7k`) cannot be a variable; a few intrinsics resolved *outside* those
tables can be — see [name resolution](#name-resolution) for what that costs you.

<a id="name-resolution"></a>
### Name resolution — how BR decides what a token is
BR does **not** decide by looking the name up in a symbol table. It decides by 
**arity**: on meeting a token that matches a keyword or intrinsic, it checks whether 
the **mandatory operands that name requires are actually present**. If they are, the 
token is accepted as that keyword or function. If they are not, BR moves on, and 
the token eventually resolves as a variable.

This is the general rule behind BR's positional lexicon — the same mechanism that lets a label or
variable reuse a statement-keyword spelling. Its sharpest consequence involves the intrinsics that
live outside `table6k`/`table7k` (`ABS`, `INT`, `SGN`, `AIDX`, `DIDX`, `NEXT`), which are
therefore not reserved:

```business-rules
00010 DIM AIDX, NEXT, ABS, SGN   ! legal — no arguments supplied, so these are names
00020 LET ABS = 7
00030 PRINT ABS                  ! 7        — the variable
00040 PRINT ABS(3)               ! 3        — the intrinsic, in the same program
```

```business-rules
00010 DIM ABS(3)                 ! rejected — ABS(3) supplies ABS's required argument,
                                 ! so it reads as a call; no subscript reading remains
```

So a scalar variable and an intrinsic of the same name coexist, told apart **only** by whether an
argument is present — and such a variable can never be subscripted, because the subscripted form
is always the function.

Two corollaries worth stating plainly:

- **A `DIM` does not shadow an intrinsic.** Declaring `ABS` does not make `ABS(3)` a subscript.
- **Being declared is not what distinguishes `X(3)` from `SIN(3)`.** Arity is. `X` requires no
  arguments and so yields a name that `(3)` then subscripts; `SIN` requires one, so `SIN(3)`
  is a call. Reasoning from "is it DIM'd?" gives the wrong answer for any declared intrinsic.

Writing a variable with one of these six names is legal and inadvisable; a language server may
reasonably warn about it.

**Scope: this is about keywords and *system* functions.** User-defined and library functions are
not part of this contest — every one is named `FN…`, and a variable never starts `FN`, so the
name alone settles what a `FN…` token is and no arity lookahead is needed to disambiguate it.
Their signatures follow their own rules (typed and sized returns, `;`-optional parameters, `&`
by-reference parameters, one exit), which belong to
[functions-udf](../flow-control/functions-udf/spec.md) and do not carry over from anything above.
The one rule the two do share: a **parameterless** function of either kind is called with no
parentheses — `FNGET$`, never `FNGET$()`.

<a id="line-labels"></a>
### Line labels
A name immediately after the line number, ending in `:`. Usable anywhere a line number is
expected (a `<line-ref>`). Must be unique in the program; may reuse keyword/variable spellings.
```business-rules
00050 FORMULA: LET MPG = MI/GAL   ! label definition
00100 GOTO FORMULA                ! jump to the labeled line
```

<a id="multiple-statements"></a>
### Multiple statements per line
Separate statements on one physical line with `:` (or `!:`). Useful for compact branches and
loop bodies — but see the comment-scope rules above when mixing with `!`/`REM`.

<a id="line-continuation"></a>
### Line continuation — `!:`
`:` joins statements on one physical line; **`!:`** joins them but tells BR to **LIST** each part on
its own physical line while they keep the same line number — each such part is a **sub-line**. This
is the standard way to write one logical line across several display lines.
```business-rules
00010 LET A = 1 !:
      LET B = 2 !:
      LET C = 3          ! all three are line 00010, listed separately
```
A **paragraph (line) label** may **not** follow a `!:` continuation, but it may follow a sub-line that
is commented out with a bare `!`:
```business-rules
00010 TOP: ! !:
      PRINT NEWPAGE
```

<a id="abbreviations"></a>
### Keyword abbreviations
Primary keywords (statement/command **names**) and secondary keywords (other words in a statement) may
be abbreviated (`DELETE`→`DEL`; any longer prefix also works — `DELE`, `DELET`). **The two are matched
by different mechanisms, and the minimum differs accordingly.**

**Primary keywords — shortest *unique* prefix.** BR looks the token up in the keyword table for its
position, scanning only the entries that share its first letter; two partial matches cancel to "not a
keyword" rather than resolving to the first of them. An exact whole-word match wins outright even where
a longer keyword extends it (`FRE` is the FRE command, not an abbreviation of `FREE`). Common minimums:
`PRINT`→`PR`, `PRINT FIELDS`→`PR F`, `PRINT USING`→`PR U`, `INPUT`→`IN`, `INPUT FIELDS`→`IN F`,
`LET`→`LE`, `LINPUT`→`LIN`, `GOSUB`→`GOS`, `GOTO`→`GOT`, `EXECUTE`→`EXE`, `RINPUT`→`RI`, `MAT`→`M`,
`NEXT`→`N`, `WRITE`→`W`, `PAUSE`→`PA`; the five `OPEN …` forms and both `READ` forms all share
`OPE`/`REA`. Commands: `CHDIR`→`CH`, `CONFIG`→`CON`, `COPY`→`COP`, `DIR`→`DIR`, `LIST`→`LIS`,
`RENAME`→`RENA`, `RENUM`→`RENU`, `STATUS`→`ST`, `TYPE`→`TY`, `DEL`→`DEL`, `FREE`→`FREE`.

**Secondary keywords — any prefix.** Where a statement's syntax admits a particular clause keyword, BR
compares the token against **that one keyword** and accepts any non-empty prefix of it; it does not
consult the table, so uniqueness never arises. That is what "secondary abbreviations are not unique —
BR uses the context and placement of the keyword" means. `SEARCH=` shows the difference at its widest:
it cannot be shortened at all in a table lookup, `SEARCH` being equally a prefix of `SEARCH>=`, yet a
bare `S` is accepted where the syntax expects `SEARCH=`. Two exceptions: a clause keyword in an `ON`
statement needs at least three characters, and for the `=`-suffixed forms BR takes `=>` as `>=` and
needs no space after the `=`.

**Function names never abbreviate** — always the full spelling.

**Caution:** BR auto-expands abbreviations **only inside program statements** — never in commands,
procedure files, `BRConfig.sys`, or `EXECUTE` literal strings, and never inside literals — so **spell
keywords out in full** in those places. Full appendix (every command/statement minimum):
[Keyword_Abbreviation](Keyword_Abbreviation.md) — but **the appendix is stale in fifteen places** and
the minimums above supersede it. It gives `CD` for `ChDir`, which is not a prefix of the word and which
the interpreter has no way to match; `DE`, `DI`, `FR`, `REN` and `LI` have since gone ambiguous against
`DEBUG`, `DISPLAY`, `FRE`, `RENUM` and `LIBRARY`; and nine entries are more conservative than BR now
is. The page is retained verbatim as wiki source, so do not "correct" this section back to it.

<a id="diagram-conventions"></a>
### Reading the manual's syntax diagrams
The original BR manual/wiki uses railroad diagrams (this corpus uses BNF instead). In those diagrams:
**UPPERCASE** = an exact keyword (type it, or an allowed abbreviation); **lowercase** = a parameter you
replace (defined in the following Parameters section); shown punctuation (`,` `:` `/`) must be typed;
items on the **main line** are required (if you can reach the end without passing a parameter, it's
optional); a **returning dotted line** means the item may repeat (separated by the shown `,`/`;`); `<n>`
in angle brackets is a default keyed to the Defaults list; **insertable** sub-diagrams (e.g.
`helpstring`, `share-spec`) have no start/end circles; the **end circle** marks the statement's end.

<a id="program-structure"></a>
## Program structure

- **Size limits**: up to **32,000 lines** (line numbers 1–99999); dictionary up to **2 MB**.
- **Conventional layout**: header comment block → initialize (`DIM`, `ON ERROR GOTO`) → main
  (dispatch via `GOSUB`s) → `STOP` → subroutines at high line numbers → error handler → `END`.
- **Best practices**: meaningful line labels over bare numbers; comment section dividers; keep
  related code together; one consistent error handler (`ON ERROR`); place subroutines at the end.
- **Menu-driven** programs loop: display options → read choice → dispatch (`ON … GOSUB` or `IF`s)
  → repeat until quit. (Branching constructs: [other-flow](../flow-control/other-flow/spec.md).)

```business-rules
00200 DIM CUST$*30 : ON ERROR GOTO 9000   ! initialize
00310 GOSUB 1000 : GOSUB 2000             ! main: process
00999 STOP
01000 ! subroutine … : RETURN
09000 PRINT "Error";ERR;"at line";LINE : STOP   ! handler
99999 END
```
