Primary and secondary keywords can be abbreviated on input, thereby increasing programmer productivity. Primary keywords are the names of statements and commands. Secondary keywords are other keywords used in statements (they are always capitalized in syntax diagrams, meaning they must be typed in exactly as is or with an acceptable abbreviation). Lists of the shortest acceptable abbreviations for each of these keywords are included in this APPENDIX.

An abbreviation, which is longer than what is listed is also, accepted. DELETE could be entered as DEL, DELE, or DELET, for instance.

For primary keywords, each abbreviation is unique; the rule for determining the abbreviation is explained below. Secondary keyword abbreviations are not unique; instead, Business Rules uses the context and placement of the keyword to determine its meaning.

==**Command Abbreviations**==

A list of the shortest acceptable abbreviations for command names follows. The full keyword appears with its shortest acceptable abbreviation, if any, directly afterwards.

**Caution**

Business Rules automatically expands abbreviated keywords only when the abbreviations appear in program statements (not commands or procedures) and only when they are not part of a literal expression. Some future additions to Business Rules may make a few abbreviations invalid, it is strongly recommended that you spell out all keywords which Business Rules won't expand for you when they are to remain a permanent part of your application. This includes all keywords which appear in procedure files, BRConfig.sys file or in the literal expressions of EXECUTE statements.

==**Statement Abbreviations**==

A list of the shortest acceptable abbreviations for statement names follows. The full keyword is followed by its shortest acceptable abbreviation (if any) in parentheses.

There are two special situations where it will seem as if the same abbreviation applies to different statements: with the five OPEN statements, and with the two READ statements. Although this manual describes the OPEN communications, OPEN display, OPEN external, OPEN internal and OPEN display statements separately, they are actually all variations of the same statement. Business Rules recognizes the OPE abbreviation for each. The same is true for the READ file and READ data statements.
